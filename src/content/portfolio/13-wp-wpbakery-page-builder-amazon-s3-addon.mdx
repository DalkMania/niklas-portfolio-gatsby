This plugin I developed during my time at CAKE. It's purpose is to simplify things when using WordPress on a load balancer setup and AWS S3. 

### Installing

1. Make sure that [WP Offload Media Lite][wp-offload] is installed, activated, and connected to your S3 Bucket.
2. Make sure that [WPBakery Page Builder][wpbakery.com] is installed and activated.
3. Upload this repo (or git clone) to your plugins folder and activate it.

### Usage

Just activate the plugin.
