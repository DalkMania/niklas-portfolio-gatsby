My responsibilities in this project included HTML5/CSS3 and PHP coding, and converting it into a CMS (WordPress). WordPress was chosen in order to update the content quickly and easily.

It was a very technical and well-structured website, with many different types of content., including Products, Features, Hardware, and FAQs and Testimonials, just to name a few. This version also included a layout builder, for easily creating complex layouts, with elements such as parallax scrolling images, animated buttons and more. I also further streamlined the back-end system.

At Revel, I was the Marketing Web Developer, where I created a highly customized functionality for the chosen theme, to streamline the content organization and deliver on the custom requirements the marketing team needed. Compared to version 1, this theme is even more customized to fit into the organization even better than before, with more custom plugins such as Lead Collection and Job listings integration for the HR Department.
