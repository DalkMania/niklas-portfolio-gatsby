This is a simple WordPress Plugin wrapper for HiringThingâ€™s API. Which I developed for one of my clients. It's very similar to the [Lever API WordPress Plugin](/portfolio/wordpress-plugins/lever-api-wordpress-plugin) and the [Greenhouse WordPress Plugin](/portfolio/wordpress-plugins/greenhouse-wordpress-plugin). It displays the current open positions at the company, pulling the data from the API.

### Installing

1. Upload this repo (or git clone) to your plugins folder and activate it.

### Usage

Just activate the plugin and enter your API information in the WP Admin.
