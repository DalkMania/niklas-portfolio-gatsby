Lever is an online software that helps companies post jobs online, manage applicants, and hire great employees. I developed this during my time at Revel Systems. It's very similar to the [HiringThing API WordPress Plugin](/portfolio/wordpress-plugins/hiringthing-api-wordpress-plugin) and the [Greenhouse WordPress Plugin](/portfolio/wordpress-plugins/greenhouse-wordpress-plugin). It displays the current open positions at the company, pulling the data from the API.

### Installing

1. Upload this repo (or git clone) to your plugins folder and activate it.

### Usage

Just activate the plugin and enter your Lever URL in the WP Admin.
