This plugin was developed by me, when I was experimenting with WordPress and React. It's meant to be a utility plugin when creating Headless WordPress sites with GraphQL and a Javascript based frontend.

### Installing

1. Make sure that [WP GraphQL][wp-graphql] is installed and activated.
2. Make sure that [Metabox.io WordPress plugin][metabox.io] is installed and activated 
3. Upload this repo (or git clone) to your plugins folder and activate it.

### Usage

Just activate the plugin and the data from your metaboxes will be available to you at the WP GraphQL endpoint for you to query.

[wp-graphql]: https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql
[metabox.io]: https://metabox.io
