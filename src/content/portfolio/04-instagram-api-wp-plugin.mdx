This is a simple WordPress Plugin wrapper for Instagramâ€™s API that I've worked with a quite a few times, and for which I have plans in one of my upcoming projects. I made it into a plugin to make it easier to reuse the functionality for possible future projects.

### Installing

1. Upload this repo (or git clone) to your plugins folder and activate it.

### Usage

Just activate the plugin and enter your API information in the WP Admin.
