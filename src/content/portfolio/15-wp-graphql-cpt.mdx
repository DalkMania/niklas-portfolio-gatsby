This plugin was developed by me, when I was experimenting with WordPress and React. It's meant to be a utility plugin when creating Headless WordPress sites with GraphQL and a Javascript based frontend.

### Installing

1. Make sure that [WP GraphQL][wp-graphql] is installed and activated first.
2. Upload this repo (or git clone) to your plugins folder and activate it.

### Usage

Your theme or other plugins may use custom post types and taxonomies to add custom functionality. That data or functionality may be beneficial or required for a front end or other app that consumes your API.

Just activate the plugin and the data will be available to you at the WP GraphQL Endpoint for you to query.
