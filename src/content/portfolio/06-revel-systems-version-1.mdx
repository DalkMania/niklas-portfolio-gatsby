My responsibilities in this project included HTML5/CSS3 and PHP coding, and converting it into a CMS (WordPress). WordPress was chosen in order to update the content quickly and easily. It was a very technical and well structured website, with many different types of content, such as Products, Features, Hardware, and FAQs and Testimonials, just to name a few.

At Revel, I was the Marketing Web Developer, where I created a highly customized functionality for the chosen theme, to streamline the content organization and deliver on the custom requirements the marketing team needed.
