This mockup was created with HTML5, CSS3, & JavaScript as a suggestion as to a direction where the website could go if Jack and Tony’s decided to refresh their web presence. Based on their feedback, I'm confident they will go for the refresh.

Of course the final version will be completely dynamic so that they can update the content, replace the images and so forth. My thinking was that a restaurant should focus on food and customer service - they don't have much time to spend on posting updates to their menus, etc, especially at more than one location, so the plan is to connect different APIs to help them streamline content management on their website.
