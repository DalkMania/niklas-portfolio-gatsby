CAKE is a Point-of-Sale system. I developed, coded, deployed and maintained the CAKE websites which are based on WordPress, including developing custom plugins, integrated marketing automation solutions (Marketo and Salesforce), integrated third-party APIs, custom Google Analytics event tracking and an A/B testing system accross all public properties. Technologies I worked with included (but was not limited to) WordPress, PHP, CSS3, HTML5, and JavaScript, and I had several DevOps duties which included working with GitHub, Ubuntu, The LAMP Stack, and AWS.
