Revel Systems is a hybrid cloud-based Point-of-Sale system for restaurants and retail establishments (including food trucks and grocery stores), enabling real-time access to data, with a scalable and secure solution that is centrally managed. Based in San Francisco, they have developed a quick, intuitive, and secure POS solution that far exceeds the capabilities of their competitors.

I developed, coded, deployed and maintained the Revel Systems websites which are based on WordPress, including developing custom plugins, integrated marketing automation solutions (Marketo and Salesforce), and integrated third-party APIs. Technologies I worked with included (but was not limited to) WordPress, PHP, CSS3, HTML5, and JavaScript.
